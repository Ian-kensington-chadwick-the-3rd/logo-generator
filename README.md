## Description


logo-generator generates a logo using inquirer to use your terminal as an answer/questions system if you would like to know more about inquirer 
go here https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4 . 
logo-generator also utilizes file system or filesystem (often abbreviated to fs) which is a method and data structure that the operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved. if you would like to know please go here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system .
To test whether my javascript methods were working I tested them using jest refer to what I learned for an example.

## what I learned

 * In this project I learned how to use inquirer by downloading and linking it to my page by typing the below
    * `npm install`
    * `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`
    * `const inquirer = require('inquirer')` 
 * I learned how to link javascript functions to seperate pages 
    * `const generateMarkdown = require('./lib/generateShapes')`
 * I learned how to make test using jest
